Download or fork this repository to use. Extract to a folder and open the UnitCostPrediction.Rproj file.

First, run the load_data_from_drive.R script since I uploaded the data on google drive.

Second, run the outpatient_unit_cost_prediction.R script. You can sweep the environment after running the script to save memory.

Thrid, run the inpatient_unit_cost_prediction.R script. You can sweep the environment after running the script to save memory.
